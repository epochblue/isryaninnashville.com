## About

This single-serving website helps you determine if
[Ryan Weaver](https://twitter.com/weaverryan) is currently
in Nashville, or if he's traveling. You'd be amazed how
difficult it is to remember this information.

The app was built to run on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). This
should explain the strangeness of using PostgreSQL to store
Ryan's current status. If anyone knows a better way around the
ephemeral nature of single-dyno Heroku apps, I'm all ears.
